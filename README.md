# bionic-reading
A Chrome Extension for Bionic Reading on ANY website!

This extension was made by me on May 20th in about 15 minutes of coding time. Please forgive any bugs as it hasn't been widely tested. Feel free to report them in Github Issues. Also, feel free to open a PR to fix any issues. I will review them quickly.

If there is interest, I am happy to work on this more and make it a dedicated screen reader.
